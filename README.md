# UniversityClassificationLR

## Overview
This repository contains the R code and documentation for a logistic regression analysis to predict whether a university is private or public based on various features from the College dataset in the ISLR package.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to apply logistic regression to understand the relationship between university attributes and their type (private or public) and to build a predictive model with high accuracy and interpretability.

## Contents
- `DataExploration.R`: R script for exploratory data analysis, including descriptive statistics and visualization.
- `LogisticModel.R`: R script for building and evaluating the logistic regression model.
- `Predictions.R`: R script for making predictions and creating confusion matrices for both training and testing datasets.
- `Documentation/`: Folder containing detailed analysis, interpretations, and findings.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and how to use the repository.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R scripts in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Install necessary R packages listed in the scripts if not already installed.
4. Run `ALY6015_SankalpBiswal_Week3_Winter_2024.Rmd`
